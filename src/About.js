            <h2>About</h2>
            <p className="content text">After getting my University degree in Law, I've decided to take my career to the IT field instead. I've been doing some online courses and teaching myself programming fundamentals (algorithms, data structures and programming logic), HTML, CSS and JavaScript , along with some Typescript and Java. I've worked mostly in the OOP paradigm, and I also have some knowledge of Ruby and Python. I built my first SPA with Angular and Spring Boot during the Argentina Programa Course, and now I'm doing a React Bootcamp by Yungas Lab. I'm looking forward to get a jr. developer internship so I can keep on improving my skills. I'm also studying QA/Testing on my own.</p>
